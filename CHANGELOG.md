# Changelog

## 2.0.1 (2021-01)

- Don't define database connection as sample (#11)
- Enable patching of how a metric is displayed in metabase (#9)
- Bump default Metabase version to `v0.37.7`

## 2.0.0 (2020-11-17)

- Disable implicit automatic user sync: it needs now to be explicitly enabled to prevent
  accidental permissions overwrites of metabase instances where users and groups are not
  managed by mara (#5 & #6).
- Bug fix in ACL sync: it was not possible to re-add users that were deleted before (#7)
- Bump default Metabase version to `v0.37.2`


**Required Changes**

If you want users synced to metabase, you now need to enable that in your code:

```python
# e.g. in app/ui/__init__.py 
import mara_metabase.acl

mara_metabase.acl.enable_automatic_sync_of_users_and_permissions_to_metabase()
```

&nbsp;

If you didn't pin Metabase in you local Makefile, make sure the new version still works.
